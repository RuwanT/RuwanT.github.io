I am a Senior Lecturer in the Artificial intelligence discipline at RMIT University (School of Computing Technologies). I am affiliated with the RMIT [AI Innovation lab](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/computer-science-and-information-technology/ai-innovation-lab), and the [Intelligent Automation Research Group](https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/engineering/research/research-groups/intelligent-automation-research-group). Before joining RMIT, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at IBM-Research Melbourne. I obtained my PhD from Swinburne University of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Alireza Bab-Hadiashar](https://www.rmit.edu.au/contact/staff-contacts/academic-staff/b/bab-hadiashar-alireza) and [Prof. Zhenwei Cao](https://www.swinburne.edu.au/research/our-research/access-our-research/find-a-researcher-or-supervisor/researcher-profile/?id=zcao).

I am always looking for highly-motivated students with strong mathematical background and proficient coding skills. If you are interested in working with me, please send me an email about your interests and background (attaching your CV, transcripts, and any previous research papers). Thanks!

## Research interests

I am interested in building and providing theoretical understanding of *robust computer vision* systems that can be utilized in autonomous navigation, robotics, advanced manufacturing, and medicine. More specifically, 

- **Computer vision**: Geometric vision (e.g., 3D reconstruction, Depth estimation, Motion segmentation), Robust vision (RANSAC and its varients).
- **Machine learning**: Handling data-set shift (e.g, Domain adaptation, Generalisation, Syn2Real), Learning with corrupted or limited data (e.g. Weakly-Supervised Learning).
- **Medical image analysis**: Image synthesis, computer aided diagnosis.
